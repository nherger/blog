I recently took up knitting as a hobby and as a first project I decided to knit a climate change scarf.

The colours on the scarf correspond to global temperature anomalies (base period: 1951-1980), with blue colours indicating below average temperatures and red colours high temperature anomalies. The scarf is based on the <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/Fig.A2.txt" target="_blank">GISTEMP</a> dataset. You can find the data and the corresponding colours in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1samDZQZnFs-oeV9WHlkG6xanKDimXJA1MIjirLa_A8E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">excel spread sheet</a>.
